One of the benefits of asymmetric encryption
is that you can encrypt with just the public key.
This means that you can give someone the ability to encrypt
without giving them the ability to decrypt.

The raw RSA keyring supports encrypt-only operations
when it only has access to a public key.

This example shows how to construct and use the raw RSA keyring
to encrypt with only the public key and decrypt with the private key.

If your RSA key is in PEM or DER format,
see the ``keyring/raw_rsa/private_key_only_from_pem`` example.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/choose-keyring.html#use-raw-rsa-keyring

In this example, we use the one-step encrypt and decrypt APIs.
