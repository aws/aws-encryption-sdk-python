This example shows how to configure and use an AWS KMS keyring with a single AWS KMS CMK.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/choose-keyring.html#use-kms-keyring

For an example of how to use the AWS KMS keyring with CMKs in multiple regions,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/multiple_regions`` example.

For examples of how to use the AWS KMS keyring with custom client configurations,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/custom_client_supplier``
and ``keyring/aws_kms/custom_kms_client_config`` examples.

For examples of how to use the AWS KMS keyring in discovery mode on decrypt,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt``,
``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt_in_region_only``,
and ``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt_with_preferred_region`` examples.
