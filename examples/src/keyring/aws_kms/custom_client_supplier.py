By default, the KMS keyring uses a client supplier that
supplies a client with the same configuration for every region.
If you need different behavior, you can write your own client supplier.

You might use this
if you need different credentials in different AWS regions.
This might be because you are crossing partitions (ex: ``aws`` and ``aws-cn``)
or if you are working with regions that have separate authentication silos
like ``ap-east-1`` and ``me-south-1``.

This example shows how to create a client supplier
that will supply KMS clients with valid credentials for the target region
even when working with regions that need different credentials.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/choose-keyring.html#use-kms-keyring

For an example of how to use the KMS keyring with CMKs in multiple regions,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/multiple_regions`` example.

For another example of how to use the KMS keyring with a custom client configuration,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/custom_kms_client_config`` example.

For examples of how to use the KMS keyring in discovery mode on decrypt,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt``,
``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt_in_region_only``,
and ``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt_with_preferred_region`` examples.
