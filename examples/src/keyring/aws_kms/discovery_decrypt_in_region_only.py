When you give the AWS KMS keyring specific key IDs it will use those CMKs and nothing else.
This is true both on encrypt and on decrypt.
However, sometimes you need more flexibility on decrypt,
especially when you don't know which CMKs were used to encrypt a message.
To address this need, you can use an AWS KMS discovery keyring.
The AWS KMS discovery keyring does nothing on encrypt.
On decrypt it reviews each encrypted data key (EDK).
If an EDK was encrypted under an AWS KMS CMK,
the AWS KMS discovery keyring attempts to decrypt it.
Whether decryption succeeds depends on permissions on the CMK.
This continues until the AWS KMS discovery keyring either runs out of EDKs
or succeeds in decrypting an EDK.

However, sometimes you need to be a *bit* more restrictive than that.
To address this need, you can use a client supplier that restricts the regions an AWS KMS keyring can talk to.

This example shows how to configure and use an AWS KMS regional discovery keyring that is restricted to one region.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/choose-keyring.html#use-kms-keyring

For an example of how to use the AWS KMS keyring with CMKs in multiple regions,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/multiple_regions`` example.

For examples of how to use the AWS KMS keyring with custom client configurations,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/custom_client_supplier``
and ``keyring/aws_kms/custom_kms_client_config`` examples.

For examples of how to use the AWS KMS discovery keyring on decrypt,
see the ``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt``
and ``keyring/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt_with_preferred_region`` examples.
