The default cryptographic materials manager (CMM)
creates new encryption and decryption materials
on every call.
This means every encrypted message is protected by a unique data key,
but it also means that you need to interact with your key management system
in order to process any message.
If this causes performance, operations, or cost issues for you,
you might benefit from data key caching.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/data-key-caching.html

This example shows how to configure the caching CMM
to reuse data keys across multiple encrypted messages.

In this example, we use an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK),
but you can use other key management options with the AWS Encryption SDK.
For examples that demonstrate how to use other key management configurations,
see the ``keyring`` and ``master_key_provider`` directories.

In this example, we use the one-step encrypt and decrypt APIs.
