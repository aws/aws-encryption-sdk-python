This example is intended to serve as reference material for users migrating away from master key providers.
We recommend using keyrings rather than master key providers.
For examples using keyrings, see the ``examples/src/keyrings`` directory.

The AWS KMS master key provider uses any key IDs that you specify on encrypt,
but attempts to decrypt *any* data keys that were encrypted under an AWS KMS CMK.
This means that you do not need to know which CMKs were used to encrypt a message.

This example shows how to configure and use an AWS KMS master key provider to decrypt without provider key IDs.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html#master-key-provider

For an example of how to use the AWS KMS master key with a single CMK,
see the ``master_key_provider/aws_kms/single_cmk`` example.

For an example of how to use the AWS KMS master key provider with CMKs in multiple regions,
see the ``master_key_provider/aws_kms/multiple_regions`` example.
