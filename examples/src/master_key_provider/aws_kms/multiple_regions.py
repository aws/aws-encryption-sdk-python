This example is intended to serve as reference material for users migrating away from master key providers.
We recommend using keyrings rather than master key providers.
For examples using keyrings, see the ``examples/src/keyrings`` directory.

This example shows how to configure and use an AWS KMS master key provider with with CMKs in multiple regions.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html#master-key-provider

For an example of how to use the AWS KMS master key with a single CMK,
see the ``master_key_provider/aws_kms/single_cmk`` example.

For an example of how to use the AWS KMS master key provider in discovery mode on decrypt,
see the ``master_key_provider/aws_kms/discovery_decrypt`` example.
