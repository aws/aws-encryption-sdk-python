This example sets up the KMS Keyring

The AWS KMS keyring uses symmetric encryption KMS keys to generate, encrypt and
decrypt data keys. This example creates a KMS Keyring and then encrypts a custom input EXAMPLE_DATA
with an encryption context. This example also includes some sanity checks for demonstration:
1. Ciphertext and plaintext data are not the same
2. Encryption context is correct in the decrypted message header
3. Decrypted plaintext value matches EXAMPLE_DATA
These sanity checks are for demonstration in the example only. You do not need these in your code.

AWS KMS keyrings can be used independently or in a multi-keyring with other keyrings
of the same or a different type.

For more information on how to use KMS keyrings, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/use-kms-keyring.html
