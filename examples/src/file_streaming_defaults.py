This example shows how to use the streaming encrypt and decrypt APIs when working with files.

One benefit of using the streaming API is that
we can check the encryption context in the header before we start decrypting.

In this example, we use an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK),
but you can use other key management options with the AWS Encryption SDK.
For examples that demonstrate how to use other key management configurations,
see the ``keyring`` and ``master_key_provider`` directories.
