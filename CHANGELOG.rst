1.9.0 -- 2021-05-27
===================

--------
* Improvements to the message decryption process

  See https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/security/advisories/GHSA-x5h4-9gqw-942j.

1.7.1 -- 2020-09-24
===================

Bugfix
--------
* Reintroduce removed symbol in top-level ``aws_encryption_sdk`` module

1.7.0 -- 2020-09-24
===================

Features
--------
* Updates to the AWS Encryption SDK. ef90351

Deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``KMSMasterKeyProvider`` is deprecated. Customers should move to ``StrictAwsKmsMasterKeyProvider``
  with explicit key ids, or ``DiscoveryAwsKmsMasterKeyProvider`` to allow decryption of any
  ciphertext to which the application has access.
* The ``encrypt``, ``decrypt``, and ``stream`` methods in the ``aws_encryption_sdk`` module are
  deprecated. Customers should move to the identically named methods on the new ``EncryptionSDKClient``
  class.

See `Migration guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/migration.html>`_
for more details.

1.4.1 -- 2019-09-20
===================

Bugfixes
--------

* Fix region configuration override in botocore sessions.
  `#190 <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/issues/190>`_
  `#193 <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/pull/193>`_

Minor
-----

* Caching CMM must require that max age configuration value is greater than 0.
  `#147 <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/issues/147>`_
  `#172 <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/pull/172>`_

1.4.0 -- 2019-05-23
===================

Minor
-----

* Remove dependence on all ``source_stream`` APIs except for ``read()``.
  `#103 <https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/issues/103>`_

Potentially Backwards Incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Encryption streams no longer close the ``source_stream`` when they themselves close.
  If you are using context managers for all of your stream handling,
  this change will not affect you.
  However, if you have been relying on the ``StreamDecryptor``
  or ``StreamEncryptor`` to close your ``source_stream`` for you,
  you will now need to close those streams yourself.
* ``StreamDecryptor.body_start`` and ``StreamDecryptor.body_end``,
  deprecated in a prior release,
  have now been removed.

Maintenance
-----------

* Move all remaining ``unittest`` tests to ``pytest``.
